/** J. C. Siebeneichler, December 2012.

Commands are strings which begin with a . (full stop) in WEC input.

A command struct has three values:
	1) Command name: the string which causes the function to be called;
	2) Function: the function which will be called;
	3) Parametre quantity: how many parametres the function expects; -1 if every
		string up to the next command call.
	
A command function has two parametres:
	1) State: a string which represents the current state of the parse;
	2) Parametres: an array of strings containing the parametres.
*/


/** Returns a command structure, with the variables:
	cn: command name, should begin with a full stop;
	f: what function should be called when the command is identified;
	pq: parametre quantity; -1 for indefinite.
*/
function declare_command(cn, f, pq) {
	var command;
	command.cn = cn;
	command.f = f;
	command.pq = pq;
	return command;
}

function is_command(s) {
	return (s.charAt(0) == ".");
